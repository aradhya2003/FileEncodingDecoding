# Huffman Coding with C++

This project demonstrates Huffman coding, a popular data compression algorithm, implemented in C++. The codebase includes functions to encode and decode text using Huffman coding.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ libraries

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the C++ code:

   ```bash
   cd huffman-cpp
   ```

3. Compile the C++ program:

   ```bash
   g++ huffman.cpp -o huffman
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./huffman
   ```

## Usage

The `huffman.cpp` file contains the implementation of Huffman coding. The `main()` function in this file demonstrates how to use the Huffman coding functions to encode and decode text.

To use the Huffman coding functions in your own program:

1. Include the `huffman.cpp` file in your project.
2. Call the `buildhufftree(string s)` function, passing the input text as the parameter.
3. The function will output the Huffman code for each character, the original text, and the encoded text.

```cpp
#include "huffman.cpp"

int main() {
    string s = "Huffman coding is a data compression algorithm.";
    buildhufftree(s);
    return 0;
}
```
