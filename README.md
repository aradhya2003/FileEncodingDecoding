# Data Compression Algorithm Implementation

This project showcases an algorithm for data compression, resulting in a significant reduction in data size. The solution effectively enhances efficiency, doubling resource utilization for storage and transmission.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ libraries

## Getting Started

To begin with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aradhya2003/FileEncodingDecoding.git

   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the C++ code:

   ```bash
   cd huffman-cpp
   ```

3. Compile the C++ program:

   ```bash
   g++ huffman.cpp -o huffman
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./huffman
   ```

## Usage

The `huffman.cpp` file contains the implementation of the compression algorithm. The `main()` function in this file demonstrates how to use the functions to compress and decompress data.

To integrate the compression algorithm into your own project:

1. Include the `huffman.cpp` file in your project.
2. Utilize the provided functions to compress and decompress data.

```cpp
#include "huffman.cpp"

int main() {
    // Your data compression implementation here
    return 0;
}
```
